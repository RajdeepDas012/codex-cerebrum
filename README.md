# 🧠 Gemini Coding Brain

> An autonomous AI agent that learns coding concepts every day using the Gemini API,
> commits its growing knowledge base to GitHub automatically, and builds a fine-tuning
> dataset for future offline model training.

## 🕐 Last 5 Topics Learned

- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Interval Tree using atomic node-augmentation and overlap-detection CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput time-range querying and multi-core scheduling interval management in real-time calendar applications and concurrent event-driven scheduling systems`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent BK-Tree using atomic distance-bounding and child-node-linking CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput fuzzy string searching and multi-core spell-checking in real-time auto-correction engines and concurrent dictionary lookup systems`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Fenwick Tree using atomic point-updating and prefix-sum-accumulating CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput cumulative frequency tracking and multi-core prefix query processing in real-time stream analytics engines and concurrent statistical monitoring systems`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Segment Tree using atomic point-updating and lazy-propagation CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput range-minimum-querying and multi-core interval-modification in real-time financial trading platforms and concurrent analytical dashboard engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Merkle Tree using atomic leaf-hashing and root-hash-cascading CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput block verification and multi-core data integrity auditing in real-time distributed ledger systems and concurrent verifiable database engines`

## 🚀 How It Works

```
GitHub Actions (every ~72 min = 20x per day)
        ↓
  agent.py picks next topic from queue
        ↓
  Gemini learns it deeply → returns structured JSON
        ↓
  Saves to data/knowledge_base.json
        ↓
  Writes daily log to data/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md
        ↓
  Exports training pair to export/finetune_ready.jsonl
        ↓
  Updates README stats
        ↓
  GitHub Actions commits everything automatically
```
