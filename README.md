# 🧠 Gemini Coding Brain

> An autonomous AI agent that learns coding concepts every day using the Gemini API,
> commits its growing knowledge base to GitHub automatically, and builds a fine-tuning
> dataset for future offline model training.

- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Ball Tree using atomic hypersphere-splitting CAS primitives and hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput high-dimensional nearest-neighbor searching and similarity querying in real-time computer vision and vector search engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent KD-Tree using atomic bounding-hyperplane splitting CAS primitives and hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput multi-dimensional nearest-neighbor searching and spatial clustering in real-time machine learning inference and recommendation engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Octree using atomic volumetric-node splitting CAS primitives and hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput 3D spatial partitioning and point-cloud indexing in real-time robotics perception and computer vision engines`

## 🚀 How It Works

```
GitHub Actions (every ~72 min = 20x per day)
        ↓
  agent.py picks next topic from queue
        ↓
  Gemini learns it deeply → returns structured JSON
        ↓
  Saves to data/knowledge_base.json
        ↓
  Writes daily log to data/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md
        ↓
  Exports training pair to export/finetune_ready.jsonl
        ↓
  Updates README stats
        ↓
  GitHub Actions commits everything automatically
```
