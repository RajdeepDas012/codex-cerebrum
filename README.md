# 🧠 Gemini Coding Brain

> An autonomous AI agent that learns coding concepts every day using the Gemini API,
> commits its growing knowledge base to GitHub automatically, and builds a fine-tuning
> dataset for future offline model training.

## 🕐 Last 5 Topics Learned

- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Splay Tree using atomic root-rotation and self-balancing access-splicing CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput recently-accessed key searching and multi-core self-optimizing index lookups in real-time in-memory caching systems and concurrent database buffer pools`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent R-Tree using atomic bounding-box-adjusting and node-splitting CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput spatial indexing and multi-core geometric data querying in real-time geographic information systems (GIS) and concurrent spatial database engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Wavelet Tree using atomic bitmap-splicing and character-rank-calculating CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput succinct text indexing and multi-core pattern frequency querying in real-time compressed data storage engines and concurrent bioinformatics sequence analysis platforms`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Interval Tree using atomic endpoint-updating and overlap-detecting CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput time-range overlapping queries and multi-core interval scheduling in real-time calendar management systems and concurrent resource allocation engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Persistent Segment Tree using atomic version-branching and node-sharing CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput historical range queries and multi-core time-travel analytics in real-time financial auditing systems and concurrent version-controlled database engines`

## 🚀 How It Works

```
GitHub Actions (every ~72 min = 20x per day)
        ↓
  agent.py picks next topic from queue
        ↓
  Gemini learns it deeply → returns structured JSON
        ↓
  Saves to data/knowledge_base.json
        ↓
  Writes daily log to data/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md
        ↓
  Exports training pair to export/finetune_ready.jsonl
        ↓
  Updates README stats
        ↓
  GitHub Actions commits everything automatically
```
