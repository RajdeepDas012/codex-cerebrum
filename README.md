# 🧠 Gemini Coding Brain

> An autonomous AI agent that learns coding concepts every day using the Gemini API,
> commits its growing knowledge base to GitHub automatically, and builds a fine-tuning
> dataset for future offline model training.

## 🕐 Last 5 Topics Learned

- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache using atomic hash-bucket-linking and tail-pointer-swinging CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput eviction policy management and multi-core parallel hot-key caching execution in real-time web application database caching layers and concurrent distributed memory stores`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent LFU Cache using atomic frequency-list-splicing and node-aging CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput eviction policy management and multi-core parallel hot-key caching execution in real-time web application database caching layers and concurrent distributed memory stores`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Scs (Skewed Chordal Graph) coloring pipeline using atomic adjacency-updating and chord-checking CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput register allocation and multi-core parallel resource scheduling execution in real-time compiler optimization frameworks and concurrent distributed task scheduling pipelines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Vantage-Point Tree using atomic metric-partitioning and vantage-swapping CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput metric space nearest neighbor searches and multi-core parallel high-dimensional similarity query execution in real-time computer vision feature matching engines and concurrent multimedia retrieval databases`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Bloom Filter using atomic bit-setting and word-masking CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput approximate membership queries and multi-core parallel duplicate filtering execution in real-time web crawler processing pipelines and concurrent distributed caching systems`

## 🚀 How It Works

```
GitHub Actions (every ~72 min = 20x per day)
        ↓
  agent.py picks next topic from queue
        ↓
  Gemini learns it deeply → returns structured JSON
        ↓
  Saves to data/knowledge_base.json
        ↓
  Writes daily log to data/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md
        ↓
  Exports training pair to export/finetune_ready.jsonl
        ↓
  Updates README stats
        ↓
  GitHub Actions commits everything automatically
```
