# 🧠 Gemini Coding Brain

> An autonomous AI agent that learns coding concepts every day using the Gemini API,
> commits its growing knowledge base to GitHub automatically, and builds a fine-tuning
> dataset for future offline model training.

## 🕐 Last 5 Topics Learned

- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Tries (Prefix Tree) using atomic node-insertion CAS primitives and hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput prefix-based key lookups and autocompletion in real-time search engines and routing tables`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent B+ Tree using atomic leaf-sibling pointer CAS primitives and hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput range scans and point lookups in real-time in-memory database engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Cuckoo Filter using atomic fingerprint-bucket swapping CAS primitives and epoch-based memory reclamation for high-throughput deletion-supported set-membership querying in real-time distributed storage and caching systems`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent HyperLogLog using atomic register-updating CAS primitives and epoch-based memory reclamation for high-throughput cardinality estimation and unique-user tracking in real-time distributed analytics and stream processing engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Bloom Filter using atomic bit-array setting CAS primitives and epoch-based memory reclamation for high-throughput probabilistic set-membership querying in real-time distributed caching and database engines`

## 🚀 How It Works

```
GitHub Actions (every ~72 min = 20x per day)
        ↓
  agent.py picks next topic from queue
        ↓
  Gemini learns it deeply → returns structured JSON
        ↓
  Saves to data/knowledge_base.json
        ↓
  Writes daily log to data/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md
        ↓
  Exports training pair to export/finetune_ready.jsonl
        ↓
  Updates README stats
        ↓
  GitHub Actions commits everything automatically
```
