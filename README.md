# 🧠 Gemini Coding Brain

> An autonomous AI agent that learns coding concepts every day using the Gemini API,
> commits its growing knowledge base to GitHub automatically, and builds a fine-tuning
> dataset for future offline model training.

## 🕐 Last 5 Topics Learned

- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent BK-Tree using atomic edit-distance-calculating and metric-space-branching CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput fuzzy string matching and multi-core spelling correction in real-time search engine query suggestion systems and concurrent text processing pipelines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Radix Spline using atomic spline-segment-updating and error-bound-checking CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput learned index lookups and multi-core point navigation in real-time in-memory databases and concurrent key-value storage engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent R-Tree using atomic bounding-box-adjusting and node-splitting CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput spatial indexing and multi-core geo-fence querying in real-time ride-sharing dispatch systems and concurrent geographic information engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Skip-Graph using atomic routing-table-updating and peer-discovery CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput distributed routing and multi-core overlay network maintenance in real-time peer-to-peer file sharing systems and concurrent decentralized cloud storage engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Persistent Segment Tree using atomic version-branching and node-sharing CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput historical range querying and multi-core temporal state tracking in real-time financial auditing systems and concurrent version-controlled database engines`

## 🚀 How It Works

```
GitHub Actions (every ~72 min = 20x per day)
        ↓
  agent.py picks next topic from queue
        ↓
  Gemini learns it deeply → returns structured JSON
        ↓
  Saves to data/knowledge_base.json
        ↓
  Writes daily log to data/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md
        ↓
  Exports training pair to export/finetune_ready.jsonl
        ↓
  Updates README stats
        ↓
  GitHub Actions commits everything automatically
```
