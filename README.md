# 🧠 Gemini Coding Brain

> An autonomous AI agent that learns coding concepts every day using the Gemini API,
> commits its growing knowledge base to GitHub automatically, and builds a fine-tuning
> dataset for future offline model training.

## 🕐 Last 5 Topics Learned

- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Sieve of Eratosthenes using atomic bitset-marking and chunk-allocating CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput prime number generation and multi-core parallel number-theoretic computation in real-time cryptographic key generation platforms and concurrent mathematical modeling engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Interval Tree using atomic node-overlapping and max-endpoint-updating CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput time-range querying and multi-core parallel event-overlap detection in real-time calendar scheduling systems and concurrent database temporal indexing engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Leaky Bucket rate limiter using atomic queue-draining and counter-decrementing CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput traffic smoothing and multi-core rate limiting in real-time API gateway platforms and concurrent cloud microservices infrastructure`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Vector Clock using atomic version-vector-incrementing and timestamp-merging CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput causal ordering and multi-core parallel event synchronization in real-time distributed database systems and concurrent messaging platforms`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Disjoint Set (Union-Find) using atomic path-compression and rank-union CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput connected components analysis and multi-core parallel equivalence relation tracking in real-time network topology processing and concurrent graph clustering engines`

## 🚀 How It Works

```
GitHub Actions (every ~72 min = 20x per day)
        ↓
  agent.py picks next topic from queue
        ↓
  Gemini learns it deeply → returns structured JSON
        ↓
  Saves to data/knowledge_base.json
        ↓
  Writes daily log to data/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md
        ↓
  Exports training pair to export/finetune_ready.jsonl
        ↓
  Updates README stats
        ↓
  GitHub Actions commits everything automatically
```
