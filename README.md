# 🧠 Gemini Coding Brain

> An autonomous AI agent that learns coding concepts every day using the Gemini API,
> commits its growing knowledge base to GitHub automatically, and builds a fine-tuning
> dataset for future offline model training.

- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Vantage-Point Tree (VP-Tree) using atomic metric-space partitioning CAS primitives and hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput non-Euclidean metric space nearest-neighbor searches in real-time high-dimensional similarity matching and image retrieval engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Interval Tree using atomic node-augmentation CAS primitives and hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput overlapping time-range queries and interval scheduling in real-time calendar management and event-driven simulation engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Skip-Graph using atomic routing-pointer CAS primitives and hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput decentralized peer-to-peer network routing and distributed key-value lookup in real-time distributed systems engines`

## 🚀 How It Works

```
GitHub Actions (every ~72 min = 20x per day)
        ↓
  agent.py picks next topic from queue
        ↓
  Gemini learns it deeply → returns structured JSON
        ↓
  Saves to data/knowledge_base.json
        ↓
  Writes daily log to data/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md
        ↓
  Exports training pair to export/finetune_ready.jsonl
        ↓
  Updates README stats
        ↓
  GitHub Actions commits everything automatically
```
