# 🧠 Gemini Coding Brain

> An autonomous AI agent that learns coding concepts every day using the Gemini API,
> commits its growing knowledge base to GitHub automatically, and builds a fine-tuning
> dataset for future offline model training.

## 🕐 Last 5 Topics Learned

- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Priority Queue using atomic heap-node-swapping and index-tracking CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput task scheduling and multi-core priority-based message routing in real-time job execution engines and concurrent distributed task processing platforms`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Persistent Segment Tree using atomic node-versioning and path-copying CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput historical range querying and multi-core time-travel analytics in real-time financial trading ledgers and concurrent versioned database engines`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) using atomic node-refitting and bounding-box-merging CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput ray-triangle intersection querying and multi-core ray tracing in real-time rendering engines and concurrent geometric simulation platforms`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent SimHash index using atomic bit-rotation and Hamming-distance-calculating CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput near-duplicate document detection and multi-core web crawling deduplication in real-time search engine pipelines and concurrent content moderation platforms`
- `Implementation of a lock-free thread-safe concurrent Bloom-Cascading Filter using atomic level-shifting and bit-array-merging CAS primitives alongside hazard pointer memory reclamation for high-throughput multi-tier approximate membership testing and multi-core distributed filtering in real-time database query optimization engines and concurrent caching architectures`

## 🚀 How It Works

```
GitHub Actions (every ~72 min = 20x per day)
        ↓
  agent.py picks next topic from queue
        ↓
  Gemini learns it deeply → returns structured JSON
        ↓
  Saves to data/knowledge_base.json
        ↓
  Writes daily log to data/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md
        ↓
  Exports training pair to export/finetune_ready.jsonl
        ↓
  Updates README stats
        ↓
  GitHub Actions commits everything automatically
```
